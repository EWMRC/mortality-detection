VA-2019-24 could be dead- only on the ground for about a month in prime nesting period. Boxing
NJ-2019-26 boxing, doesn't leave area for 3 months
NJ-2019-25 controversial, no boxing, diameter ~80 feet
SC-2019-09 clearly not dead. Points dispersed over hundreds of feet
LA-2022-14 perfect example of a dead bird, clear boxing in a small radius
NJ-2018-14 holds tight (less than 82 feet diameter) but no clear boxing, and I'm not convinced it's dead
SC-2019-04 diameter 200 feet, no boxing. Really unconvinced that this bird is dead.

SC-2019-09 has a 50% threshold: 46.7150761357398 (45 mort locs)
