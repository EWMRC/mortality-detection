```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(move)
```

```{r}
mortality_classification <- read_csv("mortality_data_according_to_rules.csv") %>% 
  dplyr::select(event_id, mortality_signal)

# If fewer than 3 locations were collected per individual, set mortality signal to 0
too_few_locs <- readRDS("too_few_locs.rds") %>% 
  rename(mortality_signal = mortality_status)

mortality_classification <- mortality_classification %>% 
  bind_rows(too_few_locs)

#join in birds for which a mortality was never predicted, and set their mort state to 0
all_locs <- readRDS("predicted_mortalities.rds") %>% 
  dplyr::select(ID, event_id)

all_locs <- all_locs %>% 
  full_join(mortality_classification) %>% 
  mutate(mortality_signal = ifelse(is.na(mortality_signal), 0, mortality_signal)) #if mortality signal is NA, return 0

```

How many mortalities are in the dataset?
```{r}
dead_birds <- all_locs %>% 
  filter(mortality_signal == 1) %>% 
  pull(ID) %>% 
  unique() 

all_locs <- all_locs %>% 
  dplyr::select(-ID)
```

Write the results- doing it in small pieces to see if I can get anything to work
```{r}
all_locs %>% 
  # mutate(mortality_signal = if_else(mortality_signal == 0, NA, mortality_signal)) %>% 
  write.csv(x = ., file = "mortality_data_for_movebank_upload_2024.csv", row.names = FALSE, quote = FALSE, na = "") #, eol = "\r\n", fileEncoding = "UTF8"
```
